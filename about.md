I'm a bundle of atoms and you're a bundle of atoms, and somehow we are exchanging information through that bundles like us built. Pretty cool! 

### More Information

I'm Will Bryk. I'm currently a senior at Harvard studying Computer Science and physics. Like so many other technical blogs, this would normally be the part where I say I also like hiking, guitar, and going outside, or whatever. I don't care for those things. Instead, I want to read as much as possible before I die.
